Life is not that easy, even just making one commit a day.

mvn deploy sometimes doesn't work even if mvn install succeeds.

## go hello

Made my first Go Hello World.
https://go.dev/doc/tutorial/getting-started

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"

	"rsc.io/quote"
)

func main() {
	fmt.Println(quote.Go())
}
```

```shell
go run .
```

## git multi user

When you need to use 2 github users, set up ssh host and git config

- ssh config
```config
Host github-example
    User example_user
    HostName github.com
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/github-example
    IdentitiesOnly yes
```

- git config
```conf
[core]
	repositoryformatversion = 0
	filemode = false
	bare = false
	logallrefupdates = true
	symlinks = false
	ignorecase = true
[remote "origin"]
	url = git@github-example:example_user/til.git
	fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*
[branch "main"]
	remote = origin
	merge = refs/heads/main
```
