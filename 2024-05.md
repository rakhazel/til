When using Python requirements.txt, if the version is specified with ==, it doesn't get higher versions.

Also, use git restore to revert changes and go back.  
```
# I used this to revert to HEAD.. I think?
git restore --staged --worktree *
```

Also, sometimes git lfs is not tracked.  Use `git lfs track` then `git add`.

pip install doesn't always upgrade to latest version.  It will stop if requirements are met.  I need to do `pip install --upgrade` for latest version.
